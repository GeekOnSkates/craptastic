# Craptastic

This GitHub repo tracks my work on [the Reset64 Craptastic 4K game competition](http://www.ausretrogamer.com/2020-reset64-4kb-craptastic-game-competition/).  Competition rules say I can't actually publish my games until it's over (after June), but in July I'll be saving my work here for you to enjoy.   I'll also be putting it on [Geek on Skates Games](http://www.geekonskates.com/games).

## My Games

### 2020: Lost in the jungle

This is a goofy little text adventure filled with random.  It was a riot to build, and I hope it will give players (and judges) a good laugh too.  The game is done but not submitted yet, weighing in at a massive 3994 bytes (just a few bytes over 3.9 KB).
